# ContributionDAO
ContributionDAO - CDAO - is a DAO ( Decentralized Autonomous Organization ) designed for overseeing and governing collaborative contribution by multiple parties in public blockchain ecosystem. This DAO is chain-agnostic, it is just my personal flavor to choose ICON public chain as the target platform for its implementation. By using economic mechanism designed in this paper, anyone can build it on any blockchain that satisfy its requirements.

The ultimate purpose of ContributionDAO is to maintain a public trustless system which host and govern everyone's contribution quantitatively. All contribution proposals it hosts are evaluated and quantified by community, therefore it is publicly owned.

In blockchain networks that take contribution of participant as the key metric for reward allocation, ContributionDAO could be an important tool for identification and quantifying the merit of people.
As I know, ICON is the only blockchain project with strong emphasis on Proof of Contribution, it is the perfect candidate for experimenting ContributionDAO.

## The Purpose

Starting from being a member of ICON ecosystem, I have been trying to search for a strong system that can satisfy
* Identify, evaluate, and quantify the contribution done by participants in open collaborative environment, then reward them for their merit.
* Incubate, foster and oversee public contribution using a community-owned fund.
* As objective and unbiased as possible, AKA it must be truly decentralized and controlled by the community.

There is one thing I find strange is ICON Foundation does not offer anything close to that, although they emphasize on "contribution". Anyway, they cannot build everything alone, it may be community duty I guess.
Therefore, I have been gradually forming the idea of a DAO satisfy all requirements of that system.

And ContributionDAO is born. It has 3 sub-systems
* CDAO Contribution Quantification System
* CDAO Public Treasury
* CDAO Community Funded Project Governance
